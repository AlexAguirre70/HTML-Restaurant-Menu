        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>The owners moved from Thailand with their kids with their dreams and hopes of better and more prosperous life. Growing up in a smaller community they realized that something was missing. There weren't any local restaurants that offered authentic Thai food that they craved. So they decided to open up H-Thai-ML San Diego to share the flavors they loved with their community. Since then they have opened 3 more locations!</p>
